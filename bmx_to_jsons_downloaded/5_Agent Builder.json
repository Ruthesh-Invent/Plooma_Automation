SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: Focus on whether the core meaning and intent are the same, not just keyword overlap. The best match should describe the *same real-world issue or solution* as the query.\n        2. SPECIFICITY MATCHING: Prefer entries with a matching level of detail. A more specific version can match a general query if it falls clearly under the same scope.\n        3. CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING : Return the match only if it's semantically true, Otherwise return 'None'.\n           - For PROBLEMS: Only consider two problems equivalent if they describe the same specific customer pain point or incident pattern, not just a high-level category (e.g., electricity, billing). Minor variations in wording are acceptable, but the core issue must be the same from the customer’s point of view.  \n                Examples of semantically equivalent statements:1. \"High Electricity Bill Despite Minimal Consumption\" = \"Bill Increases despite reduced usage\"\n                                                               2. \"Unable to pay bill via mobile app – payment button unresponsive\" = \"Bill payment fails on app due to button not working\"\n                Examples of NOT semantically equivalent statements:1. \"Delay in water connection process.\" ≠ \"Delay in electricity connection installation.\" (Same category — connection — but different service domain)\n                                                                   2. \"Meter not updating units for 3 days\" ≠ \"Meter reading unusually high for one day\" (Both about meter but different issue types: non-update vs. anomaly)\n                                                                    \n           - For CHALLENGES: Only consider challenges as matching if they point to the same systemic, recurring issue — typically caused by flawed processes, system limitations, or organizational inefficiencies. Avoid matching challenges just because they are in the same operational area (e.g., electricity or water or billing). Carefully look at the description part as well to check if they are similar.\n                Examples of semantically equivalent statements:1. \"Recurring Payment Processing Issues — Customers consistently face difficulties with non-functional payment links and app crashes, leading to frustration and delays in bill payments.\"\n                = \"Recurring Bill Payment Delays — Customers consistently face issues completing bill payments through the DEWA website, including slow performance and payment timeout.\" (Both are about recurring technical failures that block bill payments through digital platforms.)\n                                                               2. \"Internal Delays in Service Connection Workflow - Service connection applications (e.g., new electricity setup) are often delayed due to manual processing, multiple approval layers, and lack of system integration across departments.\"\n                = \"Workflow Bottlenecks in Connection Approvals - Customers frequently experience long wait times for new connections caused by inefficient internal workflows, involving redundant checks and delayed routing between teams.\"(Both describe the same systemic problem — internal workflow inefficiencies delaying new connections.)                                              \n                Examples of NOT semantically equivalent statements:1. \"Delayed Electricity Service Connections - Customers consistently report significant delays in setting up new electricity connections, resulting in frustration and inefficiency.\"\n                ≠ \"Frequent Water and Power Disruptions\t- Customers are repeatedly experiencing disruptions to water and electricity services, particularly around 4-5AM on Fridays, which severely impacts daily life.\" (One is about initial service setup, the other is about ongoing service interruptions — different issue types.)\n                                                                   2. \"Inadequate Communication During Fit-Out - Customers repeatedly report lack of updates and insufficient communication about their electricity fit-out connection requests.\"\n                ≠ \"Recurring Delays in Electricity Connection-Customers consistently experience delays in the electricity fit-out connection process, leading to frustration despite professional completion of work.\"(One is about poor communication, second is about delays in execution — different root causes)      \n\n           - For RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendations should only be matched when they address the same root cause and propose comparable corrective strategies. Variations in presentation are acceptable as long as the intent and solution path are equivalent.\n                Examples of semantically equivalent statements: 1. \"Enhanced Meter Calibration Communication Strategy - Implement a proactive communication strategy to inform customers about meter recalibrations and replacements in advance. This reduces confusion and builds trust by setting accurate expectations around meter-related activities.\"\n                = \"Proactive Customer Alerts for Meter Servicing - Launch a notification system that sends scheduled SMS/email alerts to customers before planned meter maintenance or recalibration. This helps manage expectations and reduce unnecessary complaints.\" (Both aim to notify customers in advance to avoid confusion — same root cause, same communication strategy.)\n                                                                2.\"Digitize Service Connection Requests - Introduce an online portal for customers to submit electricity and water connection applications, reducing dependency on in-person visits and minimizing paperwork delays.\"\n                = \"Launch Self-Service Platform for New Connections - Enable customers to apply for new utility connections via a digital self-service interface, streamlining the application process and eliminating manual submission errors.\" (Both aim to digitize the application process to reduce manual errors and delays.)\n                Examples of NOT semantically equivalent statements: 1. \"Streamlined Refund Processing System - Revise and optimize the refund processing system to reduce delays and align with the promised 30-day timeframe. Focus on improving internal approval workflows and backend processing efficiency.\"\n                ≠\"Improve Customer Communication on Refund Timelines - Send automated updates to customers about the status of their refund requests through SMS and email to improve transparency and reduce complaint volumes.\"(One solves processing delay, the other improves communication only — different goals.)\n                                                                    2.\"Optimize Refund Approval Workflow - Redesign the internal refund approval process by reducing redundant checks and integrating automation tools to ensure refunds are processed within 30 days.\"\n                ≠\"Expand Payment Method Options for Refunds - Enable customers to receive refunds via additional channels like digital wallets or direct bank transfers to improve flexibility and satisfaction.\"(One is about approval speed, the other about payment method flexibility — different focus.)\n\n        4. IGNORE STYLISTIC DIFFERENCES: Different wording, formatting, or order of information doesn't mean different content.\n        5. CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD: Return the best match if it captures the same core meaning, even if wording differs. You can tolerate slight variation if the core issue/challenge/recommendation matches.\n\n\n{output}",
